Some people like _"personal websites"_,
but that's a terrible way to do business.

IBM. Computers. Money.

## Trickle-Down to Business

This is a business site,
and _business is good_:

- A [Grapefruit Lab](https://grapefruitlab.com) theater business
- Some [Teacup Gorilla](https://teacup-gorilla.com) music business
- [Miriam Suzanne](https://miriamsuzanne.com) is a business ~~woman~~
- Outside this window, a _24-hour Car Wash_ business
- Networking at the [Front-End "Social"](https://front-end.social) business
- Eternal [Monkeys Typing](https://monkey.writr.art/) might do a business
- Corporate _Office Max_ is across the street business
