  Principle Business Owner & Founder (Important)
---

As a business person,
I excel at business.
My primary business
is doing important business,
providing business services to other business people,
and the businesses they found (or lost).
I do business daily (if not more).

This is my business site,
for marketing the business that I do.
There's nothing to buy here,
but please buy things anyway.
That's how you run a business.

I have other businesses too.
That's what business people do:

- I'm in the [OddBird](https://www.oddbird.net) web business
- I have a [Grapefruit Lab](https://grapefruitlab.com) theater business
- I do some [Teacup Gorilla](https://teacup-gorilla.com) music business
- My [other website](https://miriamsuzanne.com) is not a business
  (but it's trying)
